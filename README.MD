# Numerical-Linear-Algebra  

This repository contains solutions to all exercises from **Numerical Linear Algebra: An Introduction** by **Holger Wendland** and a Julia module, `NNLA.jl`, implementing the book’s algorithms.  

> **Note**  
> The repository is a work in progress. While some algorithms and exercises have been implemented, more will be added over time.

## 📚 Recommended Resources  

For further learning, I highly recommend the [***Advanced LAFF***](https://www.youtube.com/@advancedlaff6453) YouTube channel. It offers well-structured tutorials covering both theoretical concepts and practical implementations in Numerical Linear Algebra.
