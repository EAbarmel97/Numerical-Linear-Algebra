## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **`code/NNLA.jl/`**: Contains the Julia module with implementations of algorithms and data structures from the book. Perfect for hands-on learning and experimentation.
- **`notes`**: Contains a LaTeX file with notes on theoretical NLA.
- **`solutions/`**: Includes LaTeX source files and compiled PDFs for all exercise solutions. Ideal for reference and self-study.

## üìö Additional Resources

If you're passionate about **Numerical Linear Algebra**, I highly recommend checking out the [***Advanced LAFF***](https://www.youtube.com/@advancedlaff6453) YouTube Channel. It offers high-quality, in-depth tutorials and explanations on topics related to NLA, covering both theory and code implementation.
