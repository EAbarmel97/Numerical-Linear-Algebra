# Numerical Linear Algebra Solutions & Julia Module

This repository contains solutions to all exercises from the book **Numerical Linear Algebra: An Introduction** by **Holger Wenland**, along with a Julia module named `NNLA`. This module includes naive implementations of the algorithms discussed throughout the book.

## Main Structure:

- **`code/NNLA.jl/`**: Directory containing the Julia module for implementing algorithms and data structures from the book.

- **`solutions/`**: Contains LaTeX source files and compiled PDF outputs for exercises.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code or using the module, clone this repository and set up your Julia environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EAbarmel97/NNLA.jl.git
    cd NNLA.jl
    ```

2. Activate the Julia environment:
    ```bash
    julia --project=.
    ```

3. (Optional) Precompile the module. Inside the REPL, run:
    ```julia
    using Pkg
    Pkg.precompile()
    ```

4. Run tests or start using the `NNLA` module in your own code!

If you're passionate about **Numerical Linear Algebra**, I highly recommend checking out the [***Advanced LAFF***](https://www.youtube.com/@advancedlaff6453) You Tube Channel. It offers high-quality, in-depth tutorials and explanations on topics related to NLA, concerning theory and 
code implementation.
